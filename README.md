# Business-Analytics-Nanodegree
This repository contains my projects for [Udacity's Business Analytics](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098) Nanodegree Program


## Part 1: Introduction to Data Analysis


> In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard about Malaria in Africa to uncover insights. Then I wrote a short report explaining each insight, and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

## Part 2: Introduction to Data
> In this project, I've used statistics and spreadsheet programs (Excel) to analyze data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. In particular, I created a Profit & Loss statement with an S&P 500 company selector widget in Excel. I also used Excel to create a dynamic income statement, where I forecasted financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for a company of choice from the NYSE dataset. Lastly, I analyzed the change in terms of Cost-of-good-sold between Year 1 and Year 3 for Materials Sector.

## Part 3: SQL for Data Analysis


> In this project, I queried a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I used the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.

## Part 4: Data Visualization

> In this project, I built interactive dashboards with Tableau and use them to discover and communicate insights from data. I used a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more.
